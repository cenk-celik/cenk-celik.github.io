 > Ethos of transparency, research integrity and keen collaboration in early career research.

I'm a Research Fellow at Genetics Institute and Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London. I study tumour mass dormancy and G0 arrest in the context of cancer evolution using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.

Using cutting-edge bioinformatics tools, I also interrogate cellular interactome and their putative implications in cancer evolution. Together, I aim to integrate transcriptomics data with spatial architecture.
