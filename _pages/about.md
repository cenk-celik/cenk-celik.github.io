I'm a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, School of Biological Scientist. I study unfolded protein response in wound healing, and several others, using bioinformatics tools. 

As a self-taught, nascent bioinformatician, I try to use cutting-edge tools to interrogate metabolic diseases at the bulk and single-cell transcriptomics resolution.

 I look forward to integrating other types of data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) to extract more insights on how diseases progress.
